## Thoughts before dropping in

While I suspect that the main subject of this project (serialization) isn't really bound to cause as much trouble as some other subjects have caused in the 
past due to the pre-existing libraries being able to do all the heavy lifting,
what worries me about this project is the way that the innards of the program
are gonna work; there's gonna be some heavy lifting on my part when it comes
to actually solving the logic of the game --which, duh'doy, that's what
programming is all about--, but we'll see how everything turns out.

## Thoughts after finishing the assignment

Overall, I had a pretty good time with this one! While I have to acknowledge 
the fact that when the moment came to actually create the saving and loading 
code, I had to fiddle around with it a little to get it to work properly, but 
it was nothing that a quick lookup on the documentation and a couple of 
tutorials didn't help me figure out.
Now that I mention it, I am still having a lot of trouble reading documentation and making a lot of sense from it; I'm pretty sure there's a big intimidation 
factor when it comes to both reading it an making it "become knowledge in my 
mind," but anyway, exposition to these concepts is bound to make them more
mundane by familiarity.
