## Thoughts before dropping in

While I suspect that the main subject of this project (serialization) isn't really bound to cause as much trouble as some other subjects have caused in the 
past due to the pre-existing libraries being able to do all the heavy lifting,
what worries me about this project is the way that the innards of the program
are gonna work; there's gonna be some heavy lifting on my part when it comes
to actually solving the logic of the game --which, duh'doy, that's what
programming is all about--, but we'll see how everything turns out.
